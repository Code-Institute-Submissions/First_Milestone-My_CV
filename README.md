# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project

# Curriculum Vitae

My Website has been developed for Code Institute's User Centic Front End Development Project 1 and represents a way to promote my self as a web developer. Itâ€™s a four pages responsive website, each area has been developed for an easy navigation and is describing who I am and what I would like to achieve. 
 
## UX
 
This Project is to demonstrate lessons learned in this section HTML and CSS User-Centric Front End Development.

My idea was to build a website that could describe part of my personality and the new challenge I am approaching at. The idea of working in the background of a project, the development of a new app or a new online service is what excites me and this is my way to communicate it to the users. 

I have divided the website in 4 pages:

- Home
- About Me
- Projects
- Contacts

## Features

The basic structure of each page is the same, this to allow the user a simple navigation.

The structure is as follow:

- Header composed of: Logo on the top left and a menu on top right.

- Background Image: on which the phrases designed with CSS have been reported.

- Footer: A responsive footer in which is implemented the use of Font Awesome and Hover.css-link for the social networks.
 
### Existing Features

My aim is to improve and increment the section of the website created once my studies will be completed. During this period and at the end of it, I would be able to add new functions thanks to the skills I will develop. In particular, I am thinking of a thank you windows after the submission of the contact form and a huge implemetn of my projects section.
