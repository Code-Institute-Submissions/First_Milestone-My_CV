# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project

# Curriculum Vitae

My Website has been developed for Code Institute's User Centic Front End Development Project 1 and represents a way to promote my self as a web developer. Itâ€™s a four pages responsive website, each area has been developed for an easy navigation and is describing who I am and what I would like to achieve. 
 
## UX
 
This Project is to demonstrate lessons learned in this section HTML and CSS User-Centric Front End Development.

My idea was to build a website that could describe part of my personality and the new challenge I am approaching at. The idea of working in the background of a project, the development of a new app or a new online service is what excites me and this is my way to communicate it to the users. 

I have divided the website in 4 pages:

- Home
- About Me
- Projects
- Contacts
