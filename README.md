# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project

# Curriculum Vitae

My Website has been developed for Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project and represents a way to promote my self as a web developer. It’s a four pages responsive website, each area has been developed for an easy navigation and is describing who I am and what I would like to achieve. 
 
## UX
 
This Project is to demonstrate lessons learned in this section HTML and CSS User-Centric Front End Development.

My idea was to build a website that could describe part of my personality and the new challenge I am approaching at. The idea of working in the background of a project, the development of a new app or a new online service is what excites me and this is my way to communicate it to the users. 

I have divided the website in 4 pages:

* Home
* About Me
* Projects
* Contacts

## SCENARIO

As mentioned above, I have created a basic website using, as much as I could, all the notions that I have received during this period. My aim is to continue building my website and develop, in particular, my projects page as that will be my business card for whoever would like to contact me and know more about my services and what I can, eventually, do for them. 

## Features

The basic structure of each page is the same, this to allow the user a simple navigation.

The structure is as follow:

* **Navbar**: composed of Logo on the top left and a menu on top right.

* **Section**: composed of a background image on which the phrases designed with CSS have been reported.

* **Footer** : a responsive footer in which is implemented the use of Font Awesome and Hover.css-link for the social networks.
 
The navbar is made up of 4 separate pages:

#### _Home_

In this section I wanted to give a first impression of myself using that particular background image, it has been taken from Google Image and retouched. I have also included my mantra using fonts taken from Google font, Balsamiq sans.

#### _About Me_

In this section I gave a description of myself and my work history. On the right of the screen I have also incuded a picture of myself.

Link to the [About Me](https://salvobevi.github.io/First_Milestone-My_CV/aboutme.html).

#### _Projects_

In this section I have created a box with the title and a brief of this first project, including an image that is actually a link to the project itself. This page will be implemented with my future projects. 

Link to the [Projects](https://salvobevi.github.io/First_Milestone-My_CV/projects.html).

#### _Contacts_

In this section I have used a background image take from Google photo and retouched. I have included my personal data such as phone number, email address and the possibility to download my cv. 

Link to the [Contacts](https://salvobevi.github.io/First_Milestone-My_CV/contacts.html).

### Existing Features

My aim is to improve and increment the section of the website created once my studies will be completed. During this period and at the end of it, I would be able to add new functions thanks to the skills I will develop. In particular, I am thinking of a thank you windows after the submission of the contact form and a huge implemetn of my projects section.

## Testing

To test this project I used various browsers and devices:

#### Mobile Browsers
* Chrome
* Safari

#### Desktop Browsers
* Chrome

#### Devices
* ThinkPad X1 Carbon
* Samsung S8
* Huawei p20 pro
* Iphone X

During testing i used Chrome Developer tools to test the responsive design on different size and the features of the page on different width.

The site was developed following the Bootstrap Grid System and the same was tested to ensure that all the elements are responsive on the following resolutions on each page:

- Width ≥1200px
- Width ≤ 600px

### Validation Testings

For HTML validation testing I used ["W3 Validator"](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgello94.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone-antonio%2F) which shows the html documents to be valid.

For CSS validation testing I used ["W3 CSS Validator"](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgello94.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone-antonio%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=it) which shows the stylesheet to be valid CSS3.

## Deployment

This page has been deployed to ["Github Pages"](https://salvobevi.github.io/First_Milestone-My_CV/).

GitHub is used to host the code and publish the pages.

After a final Git Add and Git commit

`$git add .`

`$git commit -m "Final commit"`

The pages were pushed to the GitHub repository

`$ git push -u origin master`
